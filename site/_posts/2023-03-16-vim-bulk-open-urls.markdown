I've been preparing for interviews over the past few weeks using neetcode.io as a guide.  I've also done a few problems that weren't on NeetCode in case it helps others.  I'll create a post for each problem and also keep a list of them on a separate page so that they are easy to find.

The first problem I'd like to go over is a question that I was asked in a recent technical screen.

Outline:
- Intro question, talk about process for solution (ask clarifying questions, propose high level solution)
- Go over options 
- Show solution


So recently I went through a tech screen where the question was to design a rate limiter.  When starting, it's important to show solid communication skills and also that there's a solid understanding of the problem.  To do this, you should start off by paraphrasing the problem.  Then you can talk about the edge cases .
