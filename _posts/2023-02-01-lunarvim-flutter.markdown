I've always enjoyed working in Vim because of how lightweight it felt compared to other IDEs despite the extra learning curve and overhead in configuring it.  I've recently tried [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/) and really liked the look, feel, and configurability.  I've also recently been interested in learning Flutter to quickly prototype mobile apps.  Getting Flutter and LazyVim working together took a bit of learning so I thought I'd share it here.

### Setup

First you'll need to install the following:

* [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/installation)
* [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
* [Dart](https://dart.dev/)

Since I'm on a Mac, I used Brew to install NeoVim and Flutter.  Then I followed the instructions on the respective sites.  Note: Flutter seems to install dart so that does not need to be done separately.
```
brew install flutter neovim
```

### Configuring LunarVim

### Resources
Here are some of the resources I leveraged to get setup:

* [Setup Vim for Flutter Development](https://x-team.com/blog/neovim-flutter/)
* [Create an Android emulator via the command line](http://johnborg.es/2019/04/android-setup-macos.html)
